# Runnelix history

Scope: product planning and implementation. Dates use Asia/Kolkata unless stated otherwise. This record links evidence and distinguishes completed work from proposals.

## 2026-10-17 — product plan published

- **What:** named the product Runnelix and published the planning documents in public repository `rushikeshg25/runnelix`.
- **Why:** establish readable product requirements, execution rules, and release gates before implementation.
- **Evidence:** commit [`f3f6864`](https://github.com/rushikeshg25/runnelix/commit/f3f6864264c08aa2f0b4c611c7082b346eee111b), [planning guide](docs/plans/README.md).
- **Confidence:** confirmed by the committed documents and matching remote file hashes.

## 2026-10-17 — Phase 0 implementation begins

- **What:** adopted nine meaningful commits for the runtime proof, with per-slice decisions and evidence.
- **Why:** the user requested phased implementation, 8–10 commits per phase, and a durable record of what changed and why.
- **Choice:** use a project-local Temporal development server because Docker is not running. Keep production PostgreSQL recovery unverified rather than equating it with a development restore.
- **Evidence:** [Phase 0 implementation record](docs/implementation/phase-0.md), [tool installer](scripts/install-temporal.py), [decision log](logs/2026-10-17.md).

## Open questions

- Which production topology and budget should the Temporal operations gate use?
- Which real integrations and pilot workflows come first?

Per-step reasoning lives in `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`; this history records milestones and links to their evidence.
